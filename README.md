This is collection of icons/logos for operating systems and various applications detected by [Matomo's Device Detector](https://github.com/matomo-org/device-detector). Expected use case: an audit page showing data on past user logins or current sessions.  
While most icons are 100% "official" (at the time of addition), for some more obscure or old ones I can't guarantee that a proper icon is being used. In fact, for some of them icon/logo of respective owning company or avatar of original creator is used.  
For format consistency's sake some icons may have been edited slightly:
- spacing added to make up perfect squares
- excessive spacing removed, but to still keep square ratio
- all icons with dimensions over 1200x1200 pixels were resized to 1200x1200 (I doubt that anyone would need larger versions for potential use cases)
- side-text removed, unless necessary for differentiation of the icon from similar yet unrelated ones or essential to the logo
- solid background removed (for transparency), unless it is part of the brand, or it otherwise deemed important to readability
- all icons were converted to lossless WebP format

If desired, you can see all the icons from the collection on one page [here](https://www.simbiat.ru/staticpages/devicedetector/).
